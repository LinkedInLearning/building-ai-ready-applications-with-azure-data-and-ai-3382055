# Using Azure SQL's VECTOR_DISTANCE for similarity searches

## Vector similarity searching

Vector similarity searching is a technique used to find and retrieve data points that are similar to a given query, based on their vector representations. The similarity between two vectors is usually measured using a distance metric, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. These metrics quantify the similarity between two vectors by calculating the angle between them or the distance between their coordinates in the vector space.

Vector similarity searching has numerous applications, such as recommendation systems, search engines, image and video retrieval, and natural language processing tasks. It allows for efficient and accurate retrieval of similar items, enabling users to find relevant information or discover related items quickly and effectively.

The [VECTOR_DISTANCE](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/vector-distance-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current) function is a [new feature of the Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/functions/vector-functions-transact-sql?view=azuresqldb-current) that can calculate the distance between two vectors enabling similarity searching right in the database. 

The syntax is as follows:

```SQL-nocopy
VECTOR_DISTANCE ( distance_metric, vector1, vector2 )
```

You will be using this function in some upcoming samples as well as in the RAG chat application; both utilizing the vectors you just created for the Products table.

1. The first query will pose the question "I am looking for a red bike and I dont want to spend a lot". The key words that should help with our similarity search are red, bike, and dont want to spend a lot. Run the following SQL in a blank query editor in VS Code:

    ###### Query 1

    ```SQL
    declare @search_text nvarchar(max) = 'I am looking for a red bike and I dont want to spend a lot'
    declare @search_vector vector(1536)
    exec dbo.create_embeddings @search_text, @search_vector output;
    SELECT TOP(4) 
    p.ProductID, p.Name , p.chunk,
    vector_distance('cosine', @search_vector, p.embeddings) AS distance
    FROM [SalesLT].[Product] p
    ORDER BY distance
    ```

    And you can see from the results, the search found exactly that, an affordable red bike. The distance column shows us how similar it found the results to be using VECTOR_DISTANCE, with a lower score being a better match.

    ###### Query 1 results

    | Name | chunk | distance |
    |:---------|:---------|:---------|
    | Road-650 Red, 48 | Road-650 Red, 48 Red Road Bikes Road-650 Value-priced bike with many features of our top-of-the-line models. Has the same light, stiff frame, and the quick acceleration we're famous for. | 0.16352240013483477 |
    | Road-650 Red, 60 | Road-650 Red, 60 Red Road Bikes Road-650 Value-priced bike with many features of our top-of-the-line models. Has the same light, stiff frame, and the quick acceleration we're famous for. | 0.16361482158949225 |
    | Road-650 Red, 58 | Road-650 Red, 58 Red Road Bikes Road-650 Value-priced bike with many features of our top-of-the-line models. Has the same light, stiff frame, and the quick acceleration we're famous for. | 0.16432339626539993 |
    | Road-650 Red, 44 | Road-650 Red, 44 Red Road Bikes Road-650 Value-priced bike with many features of our top-of-the-line models. Has the same light, stiff frame, and the quick acceleration we're famous for. | 0.1652894865541471 |

1. The next search will be looking for a safe lightweight helmet. Run the following SQL in a blank query editor in VS Code:

    ###### Query 2

    ```SQL
    declare @search_text nvarchar(max) = 'I am looking for a safe helmet that does not weigh much'
    declare @search_vector vector(1536)
    exec dbo.create_embeddings @search_text, @search_vector output;
    SELECT TOP(4) 
    p.ProductID, p.Name , p.chunk,
    vector_distance('cosine', @search_vector, p.embeddings) AS distance
    FROM [SalesLT].[Product] p
    ORDER BY distance
    ```

    With the results returning lightweight helmets. There is one result that is not a helmet but a vest but as you can see, the distance score is higher for this result than the 3 helmet scores.

    ###### Query 2 results

    | Name | chunk | distance |
    |:---------|:---------|:---------|
    | Sport-100 Helmet, Black | Sport-100 Helmet, Black Black Helmets Sport-100 Universal fit, well-vented, lightweight , snap-on visor. | 0.1641856735683479 |
    | Sport-100 Helmet, Red |Sport-100 Helmet, Red Red Helmets Sport-100 Universal fit, well-vented, lightweight , snap-on visor. | 0.16508593401632166 |
    | Sport-100 Helmet, Blue |Sport-100 Helmet, Blue Blue Helmets Sport-100 Universal fit, well-vented, lightweight , snap-on visor. | 0.16592580751312624 |
    | Classic Vest, S | Classic Vest, S Blue Vests Classic Vest Light-weight, wind-resistant, packs to fit into a pocket. | 0.19888204151269384 |

1. In the previous 2 examples, we were clear on what we were looking for; cheap red bike, light helmet. In this next example, we are going to have it flex its AI muscles a bit by saying we want a bike seat that needs to be good on trails. This will require the search to look for adjacent values that have something in common with trails. Run the following SQL in a blank query editor in VS Code to see the results.

    ###### Query 3

    ```SQL
    declare @search_text nvarchar(max) = 'Do you sell any padded seats that are good on trails?'
    declare @search_vector vector(1536)
    exec dbo.create_embeddings @search_text, @search_vector output;
    SELECT TOP(4) 
    p.ProductID, p.Name , p.chunk,
    vector_distance('cosine', @search_vector, p.embeddings) AS distance
    FROM [SalesLT].[Product] p
    ORDER BY distance
    ```

    These results are very interesting for it found products based on word meanings such as absorb shocks and bumps and foam-padded. It was able to make connections to riding conditions on trails and find products that would fit that need.

    ###### Query 3 results
